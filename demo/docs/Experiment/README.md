# Resources for technical writers

This is the documentation site built with VuePress. Here, I describe my own experience with various tools for technical writers.

I've tried to set up various static site generetors (SSG): Jekyll, Hugo, Gatsby, Nex.js, Antora, VuePress, and others. Many times I had problems with configuring these tools.

In these tutorials I will share my experience in setting up SSG such as Jekyll, Hugo, etc.
